Traveling back almost eight million years to our earliest primate relatives, Evolution: The Human Story charts the development of our species from tree-dwelling primates to modern humans.Investigating each of our ancestors in detail and in context, from the anatomy of their bones to the environment they lived in, Evolution: The Human Story profiles every human relative and ancestor discovered to date, and illustrates them in lifelike form.Amazingly realistic CGI and model reconstructions by the renowned Dutch paleoartists, the Kennis brothers, bring us face-to-face and eye-to-eye with some of our distant ancestors, portraying them as never before.Drawing on cutting-edge research and the latest theories to reveal new and surprising elements, shining a light on previously inaccessible and unimagined detail, Evolution: The Human Story takes on a depth and fascination that is hard to resist.", "Categories": "Earth Sciences", "Year": "2011", "Publisher": "DK, Dorling Kindersley", "Language": "english", "Pages": "256 / 258", "File": "PDF, 38.51 MB", "IPFS_CID": "QmNexcP1sS2ifEAXFboEwrdWbGzf6XnVBTbhtGw1PaZvxh", "IPFS_CID_blake2b": "bafykbzaceaxjupukgm42gkuqj7bs35p65s5pwku2fxhtsmkitv47mrcwe6vfa"}
