This comprehensive cookbook translates the famously healthy Mediterranean diet for home cooks with a wide range of creative recipes, many fast enough to be made on a weeknight, using ingredients available at your local supermarket. The structure of the book follows the guidelines of the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid. You'll find large chapters devoted to Beans and to Vegetables, the Seafood Chapter is larger than Poultry and Meat, and the Fruits and Sweets chapter, while shorter, is packed with recipes you can truly feel good eating. Recipes include Spiced Baked Rice with Potatoes and Fennel, Tagliatelle with Artichokes and Parmesan, Orzo with Shrimp, Feta, and Lemon, Za'atar-Rubbed Chicken, Greek-Style Braised Pork with Leeks, and Orange Polenta Cake.", "Categories": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "Year": "2016", "Edition": "1st edition", "Publisher": "America's Test Kitchen", "Language": "english", "Pages": "441", "File": "EPUB, 34.46 MB", "IPFS_CID": "QmWzfSAZY8yyG26J69bQjXLG3bjfnQ2ncUkymwquEH67Jy", "IPFS_CID_blake2b": "bafykbzacecalwsrvpu6t4uoencr7j6idfhdrvku5hev5fd3523rgt4spbtlpa"}
