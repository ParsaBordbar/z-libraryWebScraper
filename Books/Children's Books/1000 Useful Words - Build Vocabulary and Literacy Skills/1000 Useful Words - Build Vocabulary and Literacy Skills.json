Arranged thematically, topics include Me and My Family, Animals, How We Look and Feel, Around the World, and I know... Colors, Shapes, Numbers, Weather, and Seasons. There are also four \"story style\" spreads that tell a simple narrative and inspire storytelling skills: for example, All in a Day is about a young child's typical day, and If I Were a Pet looks at a dog, cat, rabbit, fish, and pony, and imagines what these different animals might like to do. The book is packed with clearly labeled pictures, encouraging picture-and-word association, which helps early reading, and every page features short sentences for children to finish that reinforce grammar and encourage early writing skills. The words have been chosen with the help of a leading educational consultant, Penny Coltman, and include a combination of useful and imaginative nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Young children will be amazed and delighted by all the fascinating real-world photos, things to spot, entertaining artworks to talk about, and incredibly useful words! This fun and educational picture word book is a must-have first reference title for parents who are keen to develop their child's language and literacy skills.File: American Edition, true PDF", "Categories": "Children's Books - Education & Reference", "Year": "2018", "Edition": "First American Edition", "Publisher": "DK, Dorling Kindersley", "Language": "english", "Pages": "65", "File": "PDF, 18.65 MB", "IPFS_CID": "QmR1r66pB995mbFA6kpe89gvgryQXgGyc1NX914b74SJrt", "IPFS_CID_blake2b": "bafykbzacebrfhntj63j4nhv3ra4pijr5w6nc5lrdfzkkr4maznusgcypir57u"}
