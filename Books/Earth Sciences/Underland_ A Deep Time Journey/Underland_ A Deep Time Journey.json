In\u00a0Underland\u00a0he shows us how to see in the dark. His writing is like a vortex\u2026once caught, you\u2019re pulled deeper and deeper with each page.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Andrea WulfIn\u00a0Underland, he delivers his masterpiece: an epic exploration of the Earth's underworlds as they exist in myth, literature, memory, and the land itself.

Taking a deep-time view of our planet, Macfarlane here asks a vital and unsettling question: \"Are we being good ancestors to the future Earth?\"", "Categories": "Earth Sciences - The Environment", "Year": "2019", "Edition": "Hardcover", "Publisher": "W.W.
