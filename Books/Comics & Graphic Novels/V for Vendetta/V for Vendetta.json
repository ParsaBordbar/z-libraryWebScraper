Alan Moore has led the field in intelligent, politically astute (if slightly paranoid), complex adult comic-book writing since the early 1980s. He began V back in 1981 and it constituted one of his first attempts (along with the criminally neglected but equally superb Miracleman) at writing an ongoing series. It is 1998 (which was the future back then!) and a Fascist government has taken over the U.K. The only blot on its particular landscape is a lone terrorist who is systematically killing all the government personnel associated with a now destroyed secret concentration camp. Codename V is out for vengeance ... and an awful lot more. V feels slightly dated like all past premonitions do. The original series was black and white and that added to the grittiness of the feel while the coloring here in the graphic novel sometimes blurs David Lloyd's fine drawing. But these are small concerns. Skillfully plotted, V is an essential read for all those who love comics and the freedom, as a medium, they allow a writer as skilled as Moore. --Mark Thwaite", "Categories": "Comics & Graphic Novels - DC Comics & Graphic Novels", "Year": "1995", "Publisher": "Vertigo (DC Comics)", "Language": "english", "Pages": "288 / 286", "File": "PDF, 56.10 MB", "IPFS_CID": "QmcpUycmjzF57EYxYbb3FKcreRb4D9Cto7BByeT9FMCewo", "IPFS_CID_blake2b": "bafykbzaceaexu6gnm6zwizqlkfdzgkm3a2xrxwftlqhynz5dnnlh4iv7hlmzy"}
