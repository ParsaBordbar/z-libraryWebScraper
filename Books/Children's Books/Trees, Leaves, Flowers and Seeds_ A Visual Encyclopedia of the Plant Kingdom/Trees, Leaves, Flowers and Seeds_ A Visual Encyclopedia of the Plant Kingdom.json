We need them for food, shelter, and even the air we breathe, yet we know surprisingly little about them. Why do thistles bristle with spines? How do some plants trap and eat insects? Did you know there are trees that are 5,000 years old? Trees, Leaves, Flowers & Seeds explores the mysterious world of plants to find the answers to these and many more questions. Each type of plant--such as a flowering plant, tree, grass, or cactus--is examined close up, with an example shown from all angles and even in cross section, to highlight the key parts. Then picture-packed galleries show the wonderful variety of plants on different themes, perhaps the habitat they grow in, a flower family, or the plants that supply us with our staple foods. But the book also takes a fun look at some truly weird and wonderful plants, including trees with fruits like a giant's fingers, orchids that look like monkey faces, seeds that spin like helicopters, and trees that drip poison. So open this beautiful book and find out more about amazing Trees, Leaves, Flowers & Seeds.", "Categories": "Children's Books - Science, Nature & How It Works", "Year": "2019", "Edition": "1", "Publisher": "DK, Dorling Kindersley", "Language": "english", "Pages": "192", "File": "PDF, 86.86 MB", "IPFS_CID": "QmVESS8umzPGTFUueGgQomzxiwNEZJjoMNuEFohZaEA9sH", "IPFS_CID_blake2b": "bafykbzacedoosyqiopsi4quqjc756mbo6ip6eqbq5pdjgdwrf2ybvlhclvkcw"}
