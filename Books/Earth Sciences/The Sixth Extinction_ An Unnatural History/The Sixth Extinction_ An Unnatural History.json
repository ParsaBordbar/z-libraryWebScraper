The perspective is at once awe-inspiring, humbling and deeply necessary.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0T.C. BoyleOver the last half a billion years, there have been five mass extinctions, when the diversity of life on earth suddenly and dramatically contracted. Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the\u00a0sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us.In\u00a0The Sixth Extinction, two-time winner of the National Magazine Award and\u00a0New Yorker\u00a0writer\u00a0Elizabeth Kolbert\u00a0draws on the work of scores of researchers in half a dozen disciplines, accompanying many of them into the field: geologists who study deep ocean cores, botanists who follow the tree line as it climbs up the Andes, marine biologists who dive off the Great Barrier Reef. She introduces us to a dozen species, some already gone, others facing extinction, including the Panamian golden frog, staghorn coral, the great auk, and the Sumatran rhino. Through these stories, Kolbert provides a moving account of the disappearances occurring all around us and traces the evolution of extinction as a concept, from its first articulation by\u00a0Georges Cuvier\u00a0in revolutionary Paris up through the present day.\"Powerful... Kolbert expertly traces the \u2018twisting\u2019 intellectual history of how we\u2019ve come to understand the concept of extinction, and more recently, how we\u2019ve come to recognize our role in it... An invaluable contribution to our understanding of present circumstances.\"\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Al Gore, The New York Tim", "Categories": "Earth Sciences - The Environment", "Year": "2014", "Publisher": "Henry Holt and Company", "Language": "english", "Pages": "336", "File": "EPUB, 1.89 MB", "IPFS_CID": "QmQkm1RoQFcJ8HDDdMB1VdiFFief8ELTcQHp6fe1jFDnSx", "IPFS_CID_blake2b": "bafykbzaceap2gp4jpf4lzkrv3eysgwh3aq5hu5rxjjs6zyrkgnzlvngenn2l6"}
