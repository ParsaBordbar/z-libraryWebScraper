Is adulthood an exciting new challenge for which you feel fully prepared? Ugh. Please go away.These casually drawn, perfectly on-point comics by the hugely popular young Brooklyn-based artist Sarah Andersen are for the rest of us. They document the wasting of entire beautiful weekends on the internet,\u00a0the unbearable agony of holding hands on the street with a gorgeous guy, and\u00a0dreaming all day of getting home and back into pajamas. In other words, the horrors and awkwardnesses of young modern life. Oh and they are totally not autobiographical. At all.Adulthood Is a Myth presents many fan favorites plus dozens of all-new comics exclusive to this book. Like the work of fellow Millennial authors Allie Brosh, Grace Helbig, and Gemma Correll, Sarah's frankness on personal issues like body image, self-consciousness, introversion, relationships, and the frequency of bra-washing makes her comics highly relatable and deeply hilarious.", "Categories": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "Year": "2016", "Publisher": "Andrews McMeel Publishing", "Language": "english", "Pages": "112 / 114", "File": "PDF, 14.80 MB", "IPFS_CID": "QmSLBdeNHHvjQoxDZKAZyPevr9r8nycUjLssKqs4Q6BboS", "IPFS_CID_blake2b": "bafykbzacebrgtguefbhfsaosvueaagvezykxfm6j73i2uzxmkvdnisomb5j3m"}
